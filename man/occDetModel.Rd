\arguments{
\item{taxa}{A character vector of taxon names, as long as the number of observations.}

\item{site}{A character vector of site names, as long as the number of observations.}

\item{time_period}{A numeric vector of user defined time periods, or a date vector,
as long as the number of observations.}

\item{species_list}{A character vector of taxa names for which models should be run. This is
optional and by default models will be run for all taxa}

\item{write_results}{logical, should results be saved to \code{output_dir}. This is
recommended since these models can take a long time to run. If \code{TRUE} (default)
the results from each species will be saved as an .rdata file once the species
has run. This prevents loss of data should anything go wrong.}

\item{output_dir}{character, the output directory were the output for each taxa will be saved
as .rdata files. This will defualt to the working directory}

\item{nyr}{numeric, the minimum number of years on which a site must have records for it
to be included in the models}

\item{n_iterations}{numeric, An MCMC parameter - The number of interations}

\item{burnin}{numeric, An MCMC parameter - The length of the burn in}

\item{thinning}{numeric, An MCMC parameter - The thinning factor}

\item{n_chains}{numeric, an MCMC parameter - The number of chains to be run}

\item{modeltype}{A character string or vector that specifies the model to use. See details. If
used then model.function is ignored.}

\item{regional_codes}{A data.frame object detailing which site is associated with which region.
each row desginates a site and each column represents a region. The first column represents the 
site name (as in \code{site}). Subsequent columns are named for each regions with 1 representing
the site is in that region and 0 that it is not. NOTE a site should only be in one region}

\item{region_aggs}{A named list giving aggregations of regions that you want trend
estimates for. For example \code{region_aggs = list(GB = c('england', 'scotland', 'wales'))}
will produced a trend for GB (Great Britain) as well as its constituent nations. Note that
'england', scotland' and 'wales' must appear as names of columns in \code{regional_codes}. 
More than one aggregate can be given, eg \code{region_aggs = list(GB = c('england', 'scotland',
 'wales'), UK = c('england', 'scotland', 'wales', 'northern_ireland'))}.}

\item{model.function}{optionally a user defined BUGS model coded as a function (see \code{?jags},
including the example there, for how this is done)}

\item{seed}{numeric, uses \code{set.seed} to set the randon number seed. Setting
this number ensures repeatabl analyses}

\item{additional.parameters}{A character vector of additional parameters to monitor}

\item{additional.BUGS.elements}{A named list giving additioanl bugs elements passed 
to \code{R2jags::jags} 'data' argument}

\item{additional.init.values}{A named list giving user specified initial values to 
be added to the defaults.}

\item{return_data}{Logical, if \code{TRUE} (default) the bugs data object is returned with the data}
}
\value{
A list of occDet objects (see occDetFunc), as an occDetList class of object
}
\description{
Run occupancy detection models as described in Isaac et al, 2014
}
\details{
This function requires both the R package R2jags and the program JAGS.
These are not installed by default when sparta is loaded and so should be
installed by the user. More details can be found in teh vignette.

\code{modeltype} is used to choose the model as well as the initial values,
and the parameter to monitor. There are 9 elements that define models, however not
all combinations are available in sparta. You will get an error if you try and use
a combination that is not supported. There is usually a good reason why that
combination is not a good idea. Here are the model elements available.
\itemize{
 \item{\code{"sparta"}}{ - This uses the same model as in Isaac et al (2014)}
 \item{\code{"indran"}}{ - Here the prior for the year effect of the state model is modelled as a random effect.  This allows the model to adapt to interannual variability.}
 \item{\code{"inversegamma"}}{ - Includes inverse-gamma hyperpriors for random effects within the model}
 \item{\code{"intercept"}}{ - Includes an intercept term in the state and observation model.  By including intercept terms, the occupancy and detection probabilities in each year are centred on an overall mean level.}
 \item{\code{"centering"}}{ - Includes hierarchical centering of the model parameters.   Centring does not change the model explicitly but writes it in a way that allows parameter estimates to be updated simultaneously.}
 \item{\code{"ranwalk"}}{ - Here the prior for the year effect of the state model is modelled as a random walk.  Each estimate for the year effect is dependent on that of the previous year.}
 \item{\code{"halfcauchy"}}{ - Includes half-Cauchy hyperpriors for all random effects within the model.  The half-Cauchy is a special case of the Studentâ€™s t distribution with 1 degree of freedom. }
 \item{\code{"catlistlength"}}{ - This specifies that list length should be considered as a catagorical variable. There are 3 classes, lists of length 1, 2-3, and 4 and over. If none of the list length options are specifed 'contlistlength' is used}
 \item{\code{"contlistlength"}}{ - This specifies that list length should be considered as a continious variable. If none of the list length options are specifed 'contlistlength' is used}
 \item{\code{"nolistlength"}}{ - This specifies that no list length should be used. If none of the list length options are specifed 'contlistlength' is used}
 \item{\code{"jul_date"}}{ - This adds Julian date to the model as a polynomial centered on the middle of the year.}
}
These options are provided as a vector of characters, e.g. \code{modeltype = c('indran', 'centering', 'halfcauchy', 'catlistlength')}
