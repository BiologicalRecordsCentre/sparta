\title{Well sampled sites model}
\usage{
WSS(taxa, site, time_period, minL = 2, minTP = 3,
  species_to_include = unique(taxa), overdispersion = FALSE,
  family = "Binomial", verbose = FALSE, print_progress = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{taxa}{A character vector of taxon names, as long as the number of observations.}

\item{site}{A character vector of site names, as long as the number of observations.}

\item{time_period}{A numeric vector of user defined time periods, or a date vector,
as long as the number of observations.}

\item{minL}{numeric, The minimum number of taxa recorded at a site at a given time period 
(list-length) for the visit to be considered well sampled.}

\item{minTP}{numeric, The minimum number of time periods, or if time_period is a date the minimum
number of years, a site must be sampled in for it be be considered well sampled.}

\item{species_to_include}{A character vector giving the name of species to model. By default
all species will be modelled}

\item{overdispersion}{This option allows modelling overdispersion (\code{TRUE}) in models.
Default is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{family}{The type of model to be use. Can be \code{"Binomial"} or \code{"Bernoulli"}.}

\item{verbose}{This option, if \code{TRUE}, sets models to verbose, allowing the 
interations of each model to be viewed.}

\item{print_progress}{Logical, if \code{TRUE} progress is printed to console when
running models. Default is \code{TRUE}}
}
\value{
A dataframe of results are returned to R. Each row gives the results for a
        single species, with the species name given in the first column, \code{species_name}.
        For each of the following columns the prefix (before ".") gives the covariate and the
        sufix (after the ".") gives the parameter of that covariate.
        \code{number_observations} gives the number of visits where the species of interest
        was observed. If any of the models encountered an error this will be given in the
        column \code{error_message}.\cr
        
        The data.frame has a number of attributes:
        \itemize{
         \item{\code{intercept_year}}{ - The year used for the intercept (i.e. the
          year whose value is set to 0). Setting the intercept to the median year helps
          to increase model stability}
         \item{\code{min_year} and \code{max_year}}{ - The earliest and latest year
          in the dataset (after years have been centered on \code{intercept_year}}
         \item{\code{nVisits}}{ - The total number of visits that were in the dataset}
         \item{\code{model_formula}}{ - The model used, this will vary depending on the
          combination of arguements used}
         \item{\code{minL}}{ - The setting of minL used in site selection}
         \item{\code{minTP}}{ - The setting of minTP used in site selection}
         }
}
\description{
This function is a wrapper for \code{siteSelection} and \code{reportingRateModel} that
allows users the run a well sampled sites analysis as in Roy et al (2012).

\examples{
# Create data
n <- 1500 #size of dataset
nyr <- 8 # number of years in data
nSamples <- 20 # set number of dates

# Create somes dates
first <- as.POSIXct(strptime("2003/01/01", "\%Y/\%m/\%d"))
last <- as.POSIXct(strptime(paste(2003+(nyr-1),"/12/31", sep=''), "\%Y/\%m/\%d"))
dt <- last-first
rDates <- first + (runif(nSamples)*dt)

# taxa are set as random letters
taxa <- sample(letters, size = n, TRUE)

# three sites are visited randomly
site <- sample(c('one', 'two', 'three'), size = n, TRUE)

# the date of visit is selected at random from those created earlier
time_period <- sample(rDates, size = n, TRUE)

# combine this to a dataframe
df <- data.frame(taxa, site, time_period)

results <- WSS(df$taxa,
                df$site,
                df$time_period,
                minL = 4,
                minTP = 3,
                species_to_include = c('a', 'b', 'c'))

# Look at the results for the first few species
head(results)
# Look at the attributes of the object returned
attributes(results)
