\usage{
dataDiagnostics(taxa, site, time_period, plot = TRUE, progress_bar = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{taxa}{A character vector of taxon names, as long as the number of observations.}

\item{site}{A character vector of site names, as long as the number of observations.}

\item{time_period}{A numeric vector of user defined time periods, or a date vector,
as long as the number of observations.}

\item{plot}{Logical, if \code{TRUE} plots and model results will be printed to
the console}

\item{progress_bar}{If \code{TRUE} a progress bar is printed to console}
}
\value{
A list of filepaths, one for each species run, giving the location of the
        output saved as a .rdata file, containing an object called 'out'
}
\description{
This function provides visualisations of how the number of records in the
dataset changes over time and how the number of species recorded on a
visit changes over time. For each of these an linear model is run to test
if there is a significant trend.
