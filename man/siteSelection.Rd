\title{Site selection method}
\usage{
siteSelection(taxa, site, time_period, minL, minTP, LFirst = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{taxa}{A character vector of taxon names, as long as the number of observations.}

\item{site}{A character vector of site names, as long as the number of observations.}

\item{time_period}{A numeric vector of user defined time periods, or a date vector,
as long as the number of observations.}

\item{minL}{numeric, The minimum number of taxa recorded at a site at a given time period 
(list-length) for the visit to be considered well sampled.}

\item{minTP}{numeric, The minimum number of time periods, or if time_period is a date the minimum
number of years, a site must be sampled in for it be be considered well sampled.}

\item{LFirst}{Logical, if \code{TRUE} data is first filtered by list-length then time periods,
else time period then list-length}
}
\value{
A data.frame of data that forefills the selection criteria
}
\description{
This function uses the method outlined in Roy et al (2012) and Isaac et al (2014) for selecting
well-sampled sites from a dataset using list length and number of years as selection criteria.
}
\examples{
# Create data
n <- 150 #size of dataset
nyr <- 8 # number of years in data
nSamples <- 20 # set number of dates

# Create somes dates
first <- as.POSIXct(strptime("2003/01/01", "\%Y/\%m/\%d")) 
last <- as.POSIXct(strptime(paste(2003+(nyr-1),"/12/31", sep=''), "\%Y/\%m/\%d")) 
dt <- last-first 
rDates <- first + (runif(nSamples)*dt)

# taxa are set as random letters
taxa <- sample(letters, size = n, TRUE)

# three sites are visited randomly
site <- sample(c('one', 'two', 'three'), size = n, TRUE)

# the date of visit is selected at random from those created earlier
time_period <- sample(rDates, size = n, TRUE)

# combine this to a dataframe
df <- data.frame(taxa, site, time_period)
head(df)

# Use the site selection function on this simulated data
dfSEL  <- siteSelection(df$taxa, df$site, df$time_period, minL = 4, minTP = 3)
