\usage{
plot_DetectionPhenology(
  model,
  spname = NULL,
  bins = 12,
  density_function = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{a fitted sparta model of class \code{OccDet}.}

\item{spname}{optional name of the species (used for plotting)}

\item{bins}{number of points to estimate across the year. Defaults to 12}

\item{density_function}{whether the model used a density function to fit Julian date. This form was implemented from version 0.1.48 onwards. For models ran using earlier versions of the package this should be set to FALSE}
}
\value{
This function returns plot showing the detection probability on the y axis and Julian day on the x.
        The data within the output list shows the Julian day for each point estimated (equal to the number of bins)
        and the mean detection probability with 95% credible intervals.
}
\description{
Creates a plot of detectability over the season and calculates some simple statistics
}
\details{
Takes a object of \code{OccDet} fitted with the \code{jul_date} option

Calculates the phenology of detection and produces a plot of detectability over time for the reference data type.
