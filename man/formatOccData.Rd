\title{Format data for Occupancy detection models}
\usage{
formatOccData(taxa, site, time_period, includeJDay = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{taxa}{A character vector of taxon names, as long as the number of observations.}

\item{site}{A character vector of site names, as long as the number of observations.}

\item{time_period}{A numeric vector of user defined time periods, or a date vector,
as long as the number of observations.}

\item{includeJDay}{Logical. If \code{TRUE} a Julian day column is returned in the
occDetData object}
}
\value{
A list of length 2 the first element 'spp_vis' is a data.frame with visit
 (unique combination of site and time period) in the first column and taxa for all
 the following columns. Values in taxa columns are either \code{TRUE} or
 \code{FALSE} depending on whether they were observed on that visit. The second
 element ('occDetData') is a dataframe giving the site, list length (the number of
 species observed on a visit) and year for each visit. Optionally this also includes
 a Julian Day column
}
\description{
This takes occurrene data in the form of a vector of taxa names, locations
and time_period (usually a date) and converts them into the form needed for
occupancy models (see value section)

\examples{
\dontrun{

# Create data
n <- 15000 #size of dataset
nyr <- 20 # number of years in data
nSamples <- 100 # set number of dates
nSites <- 50 # set number of sites

# Create somes dates
first <- as.Date(strptime("2010/01/01", "\%Y/\%m/\%d")) 
last <- as.Date(strptime(paste(2010+(nyr-1),"/12/31", sep=''), "\%Y/\%m/\%d")) 
dt <- last-first 
rDates <- first + (runif(nSamples)*dt)

# taxa are set as random letters
taxa <- sample(letters, size = n, TRUE)

# three sites are visited randomly
site <- sample(paste('A', 1:nSites, sep=''), size = n, TRUE)

# the date of visit is selected at random from those created earlier
time_period <- sample(rDates, size = n, TRUE)

# run the model with these data for one species
formatted_data <- formatOccData(taxa = taxa,
                                site = site,
                                time_period = time_period)
