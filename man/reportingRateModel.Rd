\usage{
reportingRateModel(
  taxa,
  site,
  time_period,
  list_length = FALSE,
  site_effect = FALSE,
  species_to_include = unique(taxa),
  overdispersion = FALSE,
  verbose = FALSE,
  family = "Binomial",
  print_progress = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{taxa}{A character vector of taxon names, as long as the number of observations.}

\item{site}{A character vector of site names, as long as the number of observations.}

\item{time_period}{A numeric vector of user defined time periods, or a date vector,
as long as the number of observations.}

\item{list_length}{Logical, if \code{TRUE} then list length is added to the models as a fixed
effect. Note that since list_length is a property of each visit the model will run as 
a binomial model rather that as a bernoulli model.}

\item{site_effect}{Logical, if \code{TRUE} then site is added to the models as a random
effect.}

\item{species_to_include}{A character vector giving the name of species to model. By default
all species will be modelled}

\item{overdispersion}{This option allows modelling overdispersion (\code{TRUE}) in models.
Default is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{verbose}{This option, if \code{TRUE}, sets models to verbose, allowing the 
interations of each model to be viewed.}

\item{family}{The type of model to be use. Can be \code{"Binomial"} or \code{"Bernoulli"}.
Note the if list_length is \code{TRUE} family defaults to Bernoulli.}

\item{print_progress}{Logical, if \code{TRUE} progress is printed to console when
running models. Default is \code{TRUE}}
}
\value{
A dataframe of results are returned to R. Each row gives the results for a
        single species, with the species name given in the first column, \code{species_name}.
        For each of the following columns the prefix (before ".") gives the covariate and the
        sufix (after the ".") gives the parameter of that covariate.
        \code{number_observations} gives the number of visits where the species of interest
        was observed. If any of the models encountered an error this will be given in the
        column \code{error_message}. If model do encounter errors the the values for most
        columns will be \code{NA}\cr
        
        The data.frame has a number of attributes:
        \itemize{
         \item{\code{intercept_year}}{ - The year used for the intercept (i.e. the
          year whose value is set to 0). Setting the intercept to the median year helps
          to increase model stability}
         \item{\code{min_year} and \code{max_year}}{ - The earliest and latest year
          in the dataset (after years have been centered on \code{intercept_year}}
         \item{\code{nVisits}}{ - The total number of visits that were in the dataset}
         \item{\code{model_formula}}{ - The model used, this will vary depending on the
          combination of arguements used}
         }
}

Run reporting rate models to assess the change in species occurrence over time.
