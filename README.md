This R package includes methods used to analyse trends in unstructured occurrence datasets and a range of useful functions for mapping such data in the UK. The package is under continious development, but you can find stable releases in the release section. Note that frescalo currently uses an .exe compiled only for windows. 

Installation
----------------

To **install** the development version of sparta, it's easiest to use the `devtools` package:

```r
# install.packages("devtools")
# NOTE: If you have not installed devtools before you will need to restart you R
# session before installing to avoid problems

library(devtools)

# Some users have reported issues with devtools not correctly installing
# dependencies. Run the following lines to avoid these issues
list.of.packages <- c("minqa", "lme4", "gtools", "gtable", "scales",
                      "assertthat", "magrittr", "tibble", "stringr")
new.packages <- list.of.packages[!(list.of.packages %in% installed.packages()[,"Package"])]
if(length(new.packages)) install.packages(new.packages)

# Now install sparta
install_github('BiologicalRecordsCentre/sparta')

# Load sparta
library(sparta)
```

If you have difficulties installing sparta using this method try updating your version of R to the most up-to-date version available. If you still have problems please contact us or use the issues page.


Vignette/Tutorial
----------------

We have written a vignette to support the package which can viewed [here](https://biologicalrecordscentre.github.io/sparta/articles/vignette.html)

*PLEASE NOTE THAT SINCE THIS PACKAGE IS IN DEVELOPMENT THE STRUCTURE AND FUNCTIONALITY OF THE PACKAGE ARE LIKELY TO CHANGE OVER TIME. WE WILL TRY TO KEEP THE TUTORIALS UP TO DATE SO THAT IT WORKS WITH THE CURRENT MASTER VERSION ON GITHUB*
